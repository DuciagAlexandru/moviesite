# moviesite
Search for movies based on their genre. 
This application uses the BeautifulSoup plugin in order to scrap the info from the IMDB website and Youtube API v3 in order to access the info from Youtube
more easily.

For the backend I used Python/Django and for the frontend I used HTML, CSS, Javascript and Jquery.

Edit:
You will need to add a Youtube API key code into the views.py app_key in order to make the search function work properly.

Edit 2:
You will need to create a database first (db.sqlite3) by making some migrations first in order to register/login a new account.
